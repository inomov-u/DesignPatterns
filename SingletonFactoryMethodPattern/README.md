# EXERCISE 
## Implementing Logger using Singleton and Factory Method Patterns

Creatioal patterns, specifically the Singleton and teh Factory Method design patterns can be used to improve the quality of code. The Singleton and Factory Method patterns are chosen for their wide applicability and fundamental role in object creation in software design:

* **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it, offering controlled access to shared resources.
* **Factory Method Pattern**: Allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses, promoting loose coupling and scalability in applications.
